# Who's Homeless in Toronto: Major Trends in Single Adults Aged 25 to 44 Becoming Homeless from 2018 to 2024

## Overview
This study examines homelessness trends in Toronto from 2018 to 2024, focusing on demographic shifts and socio-economic factors. Findings show a sharp rise in homelessness among single adults aged 25-44, largely due to post-pandemic unemployment. The research provides insights into how Toronto can better allocate resources to reduce homelessness by targeting vulnerable groups. Stronger public policies focused on expanding support services and employment opportunities for at-risk populations are recommended.
